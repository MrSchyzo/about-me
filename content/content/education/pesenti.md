# Summary

My first encounter with programming was during my high school studies. With regards to Information Technology, this is
where I started learning although the knowledge gained here was a minuscule fraction of what I saw during my studies.

Here, I had the opportunity to program trivial desktop forms in VB6 to learn the bare fundamental constructs of imperative programming.
There was also a _brief_ introduction on HTML and MS Access with trivial SQL queries, but nothing worth mentioning.

# Technologies

If you zoom in enough in this nothingness you can spot the following:
- VB6 - as the go-to language for the exercises
- HTML
- MS Access
