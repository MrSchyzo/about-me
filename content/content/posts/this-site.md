# The tale

_Once upon a time, another developer discovered [GH Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The end._

# ...and?

Okay, for the most curious I'll go a little deeper than that, but the tale summarises it rather well.

In this post I will explain what I did to have this website up and running on the web without handling hosting, domains, etc.
Everyone with some familiarity with GitHub and Markdown should be able to make use of this.
