Well, hello kind visitor! You're here probably for one of the following reasons:
- I pestered you to look at my site because I am proud of booting up a static site
  without knowing a thing about HTML and CSS
- You were curious enough to bump into my site from GitHub
- You were curious enough to click on my "Featured" LinkedIn section
- I was brave enough to make my few social networks know about this site

Whatever is the reason, feel free to roam in this site however you want! 
~~like I had the power to force you to do otherwise~~

# What to expect from this site
The original intent of this site is to have a personal homepage focused on my professional background
and an excuse to play with some static site generator, GH Pages, and GH Actions 
(more on this [here]({{< ref "/posts/this-site" >}} "This site")).

This can of course change in the future, depending on my needs or my wishes, but for now you can expect that.

# Who I am
## Aseptic info
My name is Marco Catapano and I was born in Pisa some point in time in the 90s. I lived there for 28 years before
moving around in other Tuscanian cities.

I graduated in Computer Science in Pisa and, predictably enough, since then I worked (and am working) as a 
Software Engineer/Developer (I still can't differentiate the two terms, so I'll say both).
If you want to know more about my professional background, you might want to go [here]({{< ref "/career" >}} "career")

## Other ~~not so important~~ info
Apart from tech/coding, I can say I am curious and I tend to jump from an interest to another depending 
on the moment: there are times where I look at PC parts and compare different pieces, 
(a lot of) times where I google the first thing that crosses my mind, times where I play videogames or watch Twitch streams, 
times where I try to understand the basics of finance or science, or doing freestyle football tricks, etc.

I don't have interesting things to say about me, maybe the most striking one is the following:

> I am a coffee-free code producer

Speaks volumes about how interesting I am, doesn't it?
