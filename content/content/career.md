# About me, professionally

Basically, I am a developer/engineer and I have been working in software engineering since December 2015.
My 9+ years of experience are mainly focused in back-end application development 
and I spent these years with the intent of getting continuously better in software engineering by working in different
companies, each one with different technologies and ways of work. 
I believe that this heterogeneous set of experiences allows me to be fairly versatile and pick up new tech 
with little friction.

## Job Experience

This timeline describes my relevant job experience in software engineering, as you can imagine, the
further you go back, the foggier is my memory about that.

## Education

My experience is also backed up with some relevant education in high school and university and this helped me in make my
skill grow even more since I already had some fundamentals before beginning to work 40h+ a week.

Again, the "further => foggier memory" rule applies.
