# About me, professionally

My name's Marco Catapano and I have been working in software engineering since December 2015.
My 7+ years of experience are mainly focused in back-end application development. 
I spent these years with the intent of getting continuously better in software engineering. 
I have always had curiosity towards languages in order to improve everyday; learning is a never ending process, especially in IT.
