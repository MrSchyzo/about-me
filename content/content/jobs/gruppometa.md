# As a Software Engineer (09/2016 - 05/2018)

## Summary

I have worked in [M.E.T.A. Srl](https://www.gruppometa.it/) as a Backend Developer. I also did some _tiny_ part of frontend
but those can be summarised as "fiddling with jQuery and defining Views in a MVC architecture".

This is where I started getting the hang of VCS and web development, especially for the backend part.

## Role & Responsibilities

As a backend developer, I had the following responsibilities:
- maintaining and developing museum websites
- developing and maintaining features for a custom CMS of a school books publishing company
- contributing to a national cultural heritage ad-hoc CMS
- exploring newer versions of PHP 7 and the usage of PHPUnit

## Involved technologies

Although this web agency was rather focussed on LAMP stack + JS, I touched different technologies:
- PHP 5.3, 5.6, 7+ - as the go-to backend language
- MySQL - as the go-to RDBMS
- (loads of) XML - as the main language to define different components of the in-house framework
- In-house PHP web framework - an internal "spiritual twin" of laravel
- GitLab - for VCS
- Solr - as a full-text search database
- jQuery - as one of the frontend technologies shipped in the in-house MVC framework
