# As a Trainee (07/2015 - 10/2015)

## Summary

I have worked in [Siter Srl](https://www.siter.it/) as a trainee. This has a noticeable overlap with my experience as
an actual employee in this company, so you can refer to [this page]({{< ref "/jobs/siter" >}} "siter")) to know more about
the company and what they did.

Nothing particular to say for this: it's just my first hands-on experience outside the academic world.

## Role & Responsibilities

My project for the "internship" was to create the following:
- a JAX-WS read-only SOAP layer for a portion of the backend database
- a C# .NET winforms desktop client to consume the aforementioned SOAP layer

## Involved technologies

Nothing special, consider we weren't even using VCS ~~fml~~:
- Java 7 - as one of the languages for the "satellite" executables
- C# .NET 4.0 - as one of the languages for the "satellite" executables
- MySQL, SQL Server, OracleDB - as the supported RDBMS of the proprietary software
- SOAP - as the main server-to-server communication protocol
- WinForms - as the Desktop GUI library
