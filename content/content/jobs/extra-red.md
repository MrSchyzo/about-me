# As a Software Engineer (09/2018 - 05/2021)

## Summary

I have worked in [Extra Red Srl](https://www.extrasys.it/en/red) as a Software Engineer. At the time, Extra Red was mainly
a consultancy company with some internal projects to enhance the internal know-how. I worked on both consultancy and internal
projects and I saw a lot of projects compared to the time I spent there: at the end of this page you can find a 
[dedicated section](#what-i-did) to know more about these projects.

Here is where I feel I switched from a junior level to a mid level, if I were to gauge my seniority and confidence in my
skills. If I was able to find the jobs I've found, it's also thanks to these 2+ years here!

## Role & Responsibilities

To summarise, my responsibilities have been the following:
- Developing and maintaining features for various clients
- Participate in task estimation and scrum meetings
- Contributing to (some) architectural decisions in medium-sized projects
- Developing small-sized applications in full autonomy
- Discovering unknowns in specific technologies
- Supporting clients to use the technologies we suggested as consultants
- Mentoring more junior profiles
- Sharing knowledge I gained during explorations

## Involved technologies

The amount of tech used is rather wide since I participated in multiple projects:
- Java 7 and 8 - as main programming languages
- MariaDB and Oracle - as RDBMS used in the projects
- Apache Camel (both XML and Java DSL) - for the ESB message routing definition
- JBoss EAP - as the runtime of the Camel-based middleware 
- Fuse + Karaf - as another runtime of the Camel-based middleware
- Openshift 3 w/Jenkins - as the runtime implementing the CI of the IoT project
- Spring Boot - as the go-to framework for the CRUD applications
- CDI - as another IoC framework 
- Jenkinsfile - as the pipeline definition
- Docker (including defining docker images) - for the CI of the IoT project
- Hibernate - as the go-to ORM for the CRUD applications
- ActiveMQ - as the go-to messaging system
- GitLab - for VCS
- Quay.io - as an internal Docker image registry
- Python and VB.NET - miscellaneous support

## What I did

In this company my work included:
- Contributing in a CRUD application for an e-commerce project
- Contributing in a CRUD application for a law project
- Contributing to a research project for agriculture
- Developing features for a middleware in a luxury company
- Assisting a handover for a Python backend for another e-commerce project
- Developing a standalone application for optimising the movements of an industrial machine
- Reverse-engineering a backend application for a cloud-ready temperature-tracking camera
- Developing and defining the CI of a cloud-first IoT project
- Contributing to a backend project for a highway company
- Developing features for a middleware in a banking company
- Assisting a senior consultant of Openshift for a luxury company

Some of them sound gigantic, but they're not. If you want to know more about some of the projects let me know and I can
create a dedicated post or page about it.
