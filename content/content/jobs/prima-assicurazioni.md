# As a Software Engineer (05/2021 - 04/2022)

## Summary

I have worked in [Prima Assicurazioni SpA](https://www.prima.it/) as a Software Engineer in the "Intermediari" team. Being part of 
the "Intermediari" team implies providing a platform for all the Insurance Agents that are selling Prima's products. 
The didn't have a separation between backend engineers and frontend engineers: everyone had to contribute to both ends of the
platform in order to ship new features. The features I contributed to were used to:
- enhance Agents' experience, like a calendar used to aggregate which notable events were due (e.g. payments, expirations)
- increase the cross-sell capabilities of the Agents', like the integration with the Home Insurance product

## Role & Responsibilities

As a software engineer, my responsibilities mainly revolve around being an owner of the teams' project and sometimes contributing
to other teams' projects. To give a non-exhaustive list, a Software Engineer in Prima has to:
- develop and maintain teams' µservices
- participating in the team's discussions around what to develop and provide technical insights
- interact with external teams when an integration is needed
- onboard newcomers and mentoring more junior engineers
- complying and contributing to the technical best practices

## Involved technologies

In "Intermediari" team, we used:
- Rust - as the backend language
- Actix Web - as the web framework
- Diesel - as the go-to ORM
- DataDog - as the observability platform
- EKS - as the container orchestrator
- GitHub - as VCS and CI
- PostgreSQL - as the RDBMS
- Elm - as the frontend language
- Robot Framework - as the e2e automated testing framework
- Braintree - as the payments' provider

When contributing to other µservices, technologies also implied:
- Elixir - as one of the main backend languages
- PHP - as the Prima's monolith backend language
